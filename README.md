# Fullstack Project with Google Template, Spring, and SQL Database

Welcome to my fullstack project! This project combines a frontend built using a Google template, a backend implemented with Spring in Java, and a SQL database for data storage.

## Overview

The project is structured as follows:

- **Frontend:** Utilizes [Google's Template](https://template-link) for a responsive and modern user interface. The frontend code is located in the `frontend/` directory.

- **Backend:** Developed using the Spring framework in Java. The backend code is organized in the `backend/` directory.

- **Database:** SQL database is used to store and retrieve data. Database schema and scripts can be found in the `database/` directory.


## Configuration

Ensure that you configure the necessary environment variables, settings, and connection strings for both the frontend and backend components. Refer to the respective README files for detailed configuration instructions.
